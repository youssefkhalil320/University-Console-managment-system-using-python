# University Management System

The University Management Application is a Python-based GUI application developed using PyQt5. It provides functionality to manage students and workers at a university. The application allows users to:
- Add new students and workers.
- Find students and workers by name or ID.
- Sort students and workers by name or ID.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- PyQt5

### 1. Cloning the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://https://github.com/youssefkhalil320/University-Console-managment-system-using-python
    cd University-Console-managment-system-using-python
    ```

### 2. Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual library
● Windows:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

● macOS and Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
``` 

### 3. Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies in the requirements.txt file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Running the Application

Finally, you can run the application with the following command:
```bash
python app.py
```

## DEMO

When you run the application, the main window will appear with options to manage students or workers. Selecting either option will give you further choices to add, find, or sort students/workers. The application uses a simple and intuitive interface to perform the required operations.
